## Introducing

As a developer, I'm often hesitant to deploy small projects due to the time-consuming and error-prone process. By migrating to GitHub Actions CI/CD, I can save time, reduce errors, and focus on project development. Automation of build, test, and deployment streamlines my workflow and ensures quick and efficient deployment, giving me peace of mind.

> This CI/CD process is simple and easy to implement. 
> Remember to create a **repository secret** for the remote server information and Docker login information.

### Build blog and copy files to server

The pipeline includes steps for checking out the repository, building and uploading the site, and copying the files to a remote server using SCP.

```yaml
name: Blog CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout your repository using git
        uses: actions/checkout@v2          
      - name: Install, build, and upload your site
        uses: withastro/action@v0
      - name: scp-pipeline
        uses: cross-the-world/scp-pipeline@v1.2.1
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_HOST }}
          user: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_USER }}
          pass: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PASSWORD }}
          local: /home/runner/work/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/dist/*
          remote: /home/web/static-site/${{ secrets.DOMAIN }}
```

### Build Docker Images

This action builds and pushes a Docker image to DockerHub whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. However, it includes a TODO for SSHing to a server and reloading Docker Compose.

```yaml
name: Docker Image CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Login to DockerHub
      uses: docker/login-action@v2
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
    - name: Build and push Docker
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v4.0.0
      with:
       file: ./Dockerfile
       tags: |
            <docker registry>:<tag>
       push: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
		# TODO: SSH to server and reload docker-compose
```

### Now it's easier.

## In Summary

As a developer, I confidently assert that GitHub Actions CI/CD is a game-changer for my projects. It has not only saved me valuable time but also reduced errors, giving me a peace of mind when deploying. The automated build, test, and deployment processes have streamlined my workflow and made it highly efficient, allowing me to focus solely on the fun parts of development such as creating new features or writing new blog content.
