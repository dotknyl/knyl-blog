## Introducing

As a dev, I usually don't like to deploy my own projects 'cause the whole process takes a lot of time and there's always the risk of messing things up. But ever since I switched to GitHub Actions CI/CD, I've been able to save time, cut down on errors, and concentrate on the real deal - developing my projects. Automating the build, test, and deployment of my projects makes everything easier and faster, so I can get my work out there as soon as possible and worry less about the deployment process.

> Remember to create a **repository secret** for the remote server information and Docker login information.

### Build blog and copy files to server

The pipeline includes steps for checking out the repository, building and uploading the site, and copying the files to a remote server using SCP.

```yaml
name: Blog CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout your repository using git
        uses: actions/checkout@v2          
      - name: Install, build, and upload your site
        uses: withastro/action@v0
      - name: scp-pipeline
        uses: cross-the-world/scp-pipeline@v1.2.1
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_HOST }}
          user: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_USER }}
          pass: ${{ secrets.REMOTE_PASSWORD }}
          local: /home/runner/work/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/${{ github.event.repository.name }}/dist/*
          remote: /home/web/static-site/${{ secrets.DOMAIN }}
```

### Build Docker Images

This action builds and pushes a Docker image to DockerHub whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. However, it includes a TODO for SSHing to a server and reloading Docker Compose.

```yaml
name: Docker Image CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Login to DockerHub
      uses: docker/login-action@v2
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
    - name: Build and push Docker
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v4.0.0
      with:
       file: ./Dockerfile
       tags: |
            <docker registry>:<tag>
       push: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
		# TODO: SSH to server and reload docker-compose
```

### Now it's easier.
